Model: CNN using MobileNetV2

##Problem Statement  
Crop diseases are a major cause of reduced agricultural productivity worldwide.  
Farmers often lack quick, reliable, and affordable tools for early detection of plant diseases, which leads to delayed treatment and lower yields.  
Manual inspection is time-consuming and inaccurate, especially for large-scale farms.  

To overcome this challenge, an AI-powered system is proposed to automatically identify plant diseases from leaf images and provide suitable treatment suggestions — contributing to sustainable agricultural practices.

##Proposed Solution  
We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient and accurate classification of plant leaf images.  
The system will:
1. Detect whether a leaf is healthy or diseased.  
2. Identify the specific disease category.  
3. Display possible causes and recommended treatments. 

##Future Enhancements:
- Integration with **OpenCV** for real-time detection using a camera feed.  
- Development of a **dashboard/web interface** for farmers to upload images and receive instant diagnosis.

## Week 1 Activities
